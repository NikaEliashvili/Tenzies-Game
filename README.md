# React + Vite

This app is built in HTML5, CSS And React(Vite). 

CHECK This App Here:
tenziesgame-reactapp.netlify.app

It is a very basic game for children. The main goal is to roll ten dice of the same number as fast as you can. My app saves users' track rolls and time, so users can improve their dashboards. I have used ReactJS to build this app. It was built as a part of Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
